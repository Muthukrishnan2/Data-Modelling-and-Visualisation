This data visualisation demonstrates the insights developed from financial information and sales data of a hypothetical company and the insights we have identified are:
1. Impact of COVID-19 on sales and expenses 
In period 1(2018 to 2020), the increase in sales and net income is consistent with research conducted by the NPD group, which suggests that toy sales increased from 2019 to 2020 due to more disposable income being spent on toys rather than leisure activities during the lockdown period (Tsai, 2021). Whereas, in period 2(2021-2022), although the global toy market is taking a dip in sales (Verdon, 2019), there was an increase in sales, net income and COGS, indicating TGLâ€™s ability to retain customer loyalty despite the increase in the costs of living and goods in the post-pandemic economy (Patel, 2022).
In addition, there was a decline in marketing expenses and the sales-to-marketing ratio across both periods. This trend is not surprising due to Covid-19, which resulted in budget cuts among various industries. For warranty and other expenses, there was a general increase, further reinforcing the effect of the increase in cost during covid pandemic. Lastly, the distribution of expenses remained constant over the periods except for 2019, whereby COGS decreased due to technological advancement in Japan (UNESCO, 2019).
